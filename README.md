# Packweb

Demo : [Click here](http://thebigbignooby.github.io/packweb/)

### What is this ?
Packweb is the wepack config file generator. Inspired by [Quenchjs](http://quenchjs.com), the gulp-file generator.

### Why ?

I was learning React (before `create-react-app` came along) and configuring webpack was so hard that I wanted a better way.

Configuring webpack is a pain in the ass, especially when you're just learning how to use webpack.

### How do I use it ?
Tick boxes and name your entry and output files, then copy the result and paste it in your webpack.config.js file.
